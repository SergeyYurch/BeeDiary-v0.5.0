# Bee Diary App

## Overview

Bee Diary is an application designed for beekeepers, offering two main sections: the Beekeeper's Journal and a social network for apiarists. This application provides a platform for bee enthusiasts to record and share their beekeeping experiences.

## Features

### Beekeeper's Journal

- **Hive Management**: Users can record information about their beehives, including hive location, hive type, and bee colony details. This helps users keep track of their beekeeping operations.

- **Queen Bee Records**: Users can log information about queen bees, including details like the queen's age, breed, and year of introduction. This feature assists beekeepers in monitoring their queen bees' performance.

- **Work Log**: Beekeepers can maintain a work log to record all their activities related to beekeeping. This feature allows users to plan and organize their tasks effectively.

- **Event Planning**: Users can plan future events and tasks related to their beekeeping activities. The app offers tools to help beekeepers manage their schedule and sync events with specific bee colonies.

- **Mating Journal**: Beekeepers can maintain a journal specifically for tracking the mating of queen bees. This is crucial for monitoring breeding progress.

- **Notifications**: The app provides notification alerts for planned events and tasks to help users stay organized.

- **Visual Hive Layout**: Users can create a graphical representation of their apiary's layout, showing the arrangement of bee colonies in different locations.

### Social Network

- **Post Creation**: Users can create and share posts with the beekeeping community, sharing their experiences, insights, and questions.

- **Commenting**: The social network allows users to comment on posts, fostering discussions and interactions among beekeepers.

- **Following**: Users can follow other beekeepers to stay updated with their posts and activities within the community.
